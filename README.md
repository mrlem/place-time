# PlaceTime

PlaceTime is an app that allows you to trace your whereabouts through time.

You define which places you wanna keep track of (e.g. home, work, etc), then the app traces the time you spent in each
place.

## Features

- simple: no hassle, it just works
- privacy-safe: keep control of your data - it doesn't get sent to any server (aside from google's usual data collection)

Enjoy!

## TODO

- improve geofences / map synchronization
- improve stats
- try to fix issues when moving fast underground
- allow user to resize areas
