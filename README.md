# PlaceTime

PlaceTime is an app that allows you to trace your whereabouts through time.

You define which places you wanna keep track of (e.g. home, work, etc), then the app traces the time you spent in each
place.

## Features

- simple: no hassle, it just works
- privacy-safe: keep control of your data: it doesn't get sent to server

Enjoy!

## TODO

- improve geofences / map synchronization
